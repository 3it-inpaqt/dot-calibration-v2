1- ltspice
2- xyce
##################
The sequence of actions that the ltspice package does:
a- analyzes the old netlist generated by the old code
	a- extract params --> crossbar resistances and voltages
b- generates the circuit in ltspice format (asc)
c- generates the new netlist from ltspice  : 
d- translates to xyce netlist
################## 
All settings are included in the config.py. I followed the same naming standards as in utils/settings.py but without applying them as a class named settings due to problems with the PATH env variable.

To run the circuit simulator:
1- make sure that circuit_simulation/netlist.CIR is up-to-date
2- set the following params correctly in config.py :
	patch_size_x
	patch_size_y
	hidden_layers_size
	LTspice_num_of_layers 	# make sure it equals len(hidden_layers_size) + 1
							# if not the system will exit
3- run "python run.py -f simulation_parameters.txt"

Simulation output can be found in "LTspice_output_directory"
